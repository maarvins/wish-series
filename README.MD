 ***** P.S. ****** 
 
That project was my first project developing backend and integrating with a database (mysql specifically).<br/>
With that, more time was spent learning about how to use the resources of the respective stacks. Even with a considerable deadline, I ended up missing punctuality. <br/>
I take from all this a great learning experience and the memory of hard work with not giving up in the face of difficulties, invoking in me an insatiable curiosity about these new stacks!<br/> I will seek to develop myself in the coming weeks to master both the backend and the manipulation of database.
